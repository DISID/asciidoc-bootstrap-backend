Summary of new features in version 4.0.0 planned for July 4, 2014

* End of compatibility with Bootstrap 2.
* We have adopted http://lesscss.org[Less] the CSS preprocessor to build all stylesheets.
* Accept only icons font that provide LESS source code. So we have dropped IcoMoon support.
* Icon inline macro was removed to a better compatibility with others backends.
* We have added support for Bootstrap Panel Component.
* We have added support for Bootstrap Alert Component.

[CAUTION]
====
The `toc` and `toc2` attributes are not supported as expected.

We would like to improve it in next release 4.1

If you would add a mini toc, have a look on archives's sources of this blog.

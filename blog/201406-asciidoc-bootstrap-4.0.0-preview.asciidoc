The next major version 4.0 will come with changes, as described below :

* This is the end of compatibility with Bootstrap 2.
* We will adopt http://lesscss.org[Less] to build all stylesheets. End of a CSS nightmare !
* Accept only icons font that provide LESS source code. So we dropped IcoMoon support.
* Icon inline macro was removed to a better compatibility with others backends.

In this first preview, we will explain why icon inline macro has been removed.

Want to see it (compare renders):

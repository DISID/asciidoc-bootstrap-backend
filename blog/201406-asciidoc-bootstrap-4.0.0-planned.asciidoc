Today, I've added a new project home page at url http://laurent-laville.org/asciidoc/bootstrap/[].

Even if AsciiDoc-Bootstrap v4 is still under development, the current source code is almost stable to be officially shown.
But there are no package distribution available.
So download source code from the GitHub project page https://github.com/llaville/asciidoc-bootstrap-backend/archive/v4.zip[]

*The final stable release is planned for July 4, 2014*

Today, I've added support of http://getbootstrap.com/components/#alerts[Bootstrap Alert Component].

You can now either use *Alert* or *Panel* to display basic notification messages. 
More styles will come later.

Begin with the default theme, and switch later on other skins (even with html5 backend) :

* http://laurent-laville.org/asciidoc/bootstrap/manual/4.0/en/alerts.default.html[Alert] Component.

.with Alert Component:
====
[alert,info]
.Heads up!
--
This alert needs your attention, but it's not super important.
--
====

.with Panel Component:
====
[panel,danger,dismiss]
.Oh snap!
--
Change a few things up and try submitting again.

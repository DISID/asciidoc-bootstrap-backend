= Bootstrap backend for AsciiDoc

An AsciiDoc backend that renders the AsciiDoc source as HTML5
in the style of the http://getbootstrap.com/[Twitter Bootstrap docs].

NOTE: The latest distribution 2.0.0 support http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2[Bootstrap 2].
A future major version 3.0.0 should come to support http://getbootstrap.com[Bootstrap 3].

== Installation

To install the bootstrap backend, follow instructions
on http://laurent-laville.org/asciidoc/bootstrap/index.html[Getting Started] page.

== Usage

Use the 'bootstrap' backend as you would the built-in backends.

== Example

As you would expect, the rendered output looks shockingly similar to the Twitter Bootstrap documentation.

Compare the original http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/base-css.html[Base CSS] chapter
with this http://laurent-laville.org/asciidoc/base-css-book/base-css-book.html[HTML output],
from this https://raw.github.com/llaville/asciidoc-bootstrap-backend/master/examples/base-css-book.asciidoc[source file].

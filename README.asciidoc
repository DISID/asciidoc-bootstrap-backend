= bootstrap backend for AsciiDoc

An AsciiDoc backend that renders the AsciiDoc source as HTML5
in the style of the http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap[Twitter Bootstrap docs].

== Installation

To install the bootstrap backend, follow instructions
on http://laurent-laville.org/asciidoc/bootstrap/getting-started.html[Getting Started] page.

== Usage

Use the 'bootstrap' backend as you would the built-in backends.

== Example

As you would expect, the rendered output looks shockingly similar to the Twitter Bootstrap documentation.

Compare the original http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/base-css.html[Base CSS] chapter
with this http://laurent-laville.org/asciidoc/base-css-book/base-css-book.html[HTML output],
from this https://raw.github.com/llaville/asciidoc-bootstrap-backend/master/examples/base-css-book.asciidoc[source file].
